## Features

- 3D visualization of neural connections and data points.
- Interactive interface for exploring the network.
- Customizable settings to adjust visualization parameters.
- Easy to integrate into web applications or educational resources.

## How to Use

    Upon opening the visualization, you'll see a 3D space with neural connections and data points.
    You can interact with the visualization. Explore and rotate the network to gain insights into its structure.
    Click on the network to trigger actions or further analyze specific data points.

## Customization

You can customize the visualization by modifying the JavaScript options in the index.js file. These options include parameters related to the network's appearance and behavior. Feel free to experiment and adjust the settings to suit your needs.
